This should fix dark mode for elementary's System Settings.
Open your terminal and type in the following and a setup should appear.
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KorbsStudio/elementary-settings-dark-mode-fix/master/install-dark-mode-into-settings.sh)
```
Don't worry, the file that opens your system settings will be back up to `/usr/share/korbs-studio/` if something breaks.

This repo will be archived when [elementary OS 6.0](https://blog.elementary.io/dark-style-progress/) is released, as the new major update includes dark mode with the new stylesheet includes.
